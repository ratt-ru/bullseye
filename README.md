Build instructions (outputs CPU and GPU single and double precision libraries and a python wrapper for these)
- run: python setup.py install --user (this will install into the python user directory)

Run instructions
- Navigate to the bullseye/bullseye directory
- "./bullseye_pipeliner.py --help" to display a full list of options
- Enjoy

Toy GUI is available (proof of concept demonstrator for targeted faceting)
- "./bullseye_gui.py"
